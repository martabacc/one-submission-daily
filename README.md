# Playground

Backup for coding exercise files.
Some of these codes arent mine, you may check at the head lines of the codes.

## Written in
Mostly C++, but also use Javascript (Nodejs), Golang and Python as some concepts (data structure, STL) may implemented differently in each language.


## Prerequisites
* Having gcc and g++ installed (c++14 better), along with build-essentials
* Shell

> PS: Since currently my workspace is on mac, I don't have `bits/stdc++` header. It would be easier to use that header as the intention of this repo is to exercise on coding essential skills despite of its ineficiency.

## Convention

Header of the file includes this following comment:

```c
/*
 * Algorithms / Hackerrank                     # Section name
 * Queue / Mountain Climbing                   # Problem Name
 * https://hackerrank.com/problem/lorem-ipsum  # URL, if any
 * Notes: Lorem ipsum                          # Notes, if any
 */
```

> Some of them may not include this, gonna fix it shortly
