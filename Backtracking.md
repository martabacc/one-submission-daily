# [Algorithms: Backtracking](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backtracking-algorithms/)

Backtracking can be defined as a general algorithmic technique that considers searching every possible combination in order to solve a computational problem.

There are three types of problems in backtracking
- Decision Problem – In this, we search for a feasible solution.
- Optimization Problem – In this, we search for the best solution.
- Enumeration Problem – In this, we find all feasible solutions.
