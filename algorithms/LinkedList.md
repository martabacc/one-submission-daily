# Data Structure: LinkedList


A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.

## LinkedList versus array
Arrays can be used to store linear data of similar types, but arrays have following limitations.
- The size of the arrays is fixed: So we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance. Also, generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage.
- Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive, because room has to be created for the new elements and to create room existing elements have to shifted.

Tradeoffs:
- Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node. So we cannot do binary search with linked lists efficiently with its default implementation. Read about it here.
- Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.
- Not cache friendly. Since array elements are contiguous locations, there is locality of reference which is not there in case of linked lists.

```cpp
class Node  
{  
    public:
    int data;  
    Node *next;  
};
```

## Insertion
```cpp
void push(struct Node** head_ref, int new_data)
{
    /* 1. allocate node */
    struct Node* new_node = (struct Node*) malloc(sizeof(struct Node));

    /* 2. put in the data  */
    new_node->data  = new_data;

    /* 3. Make next of new node as head */
    new_node->next = (*head_ref);

    /* 4. move the head to point to the new node */
    (*head_ref)    = new_node;
}
```

### Insertion at N
```cpp
void insertAfter(struct Node* prev_node, int new_data)
{
    /*1. check if the given prev_node is NULL */
    if (prev_node == NULL)  
    {  
       printf("the given previous node cannot be NULL");        
       return;   
    }   

    /* 2. allocate new node */
    struct Node* new_node =(struct Node*) malloc(sizeof(struct Node));

    /* 3. put in the data  */
    new_node->data  = new_data;

    /* 4. Make next of new node as next of prev_node */
    new_node->next = prev_node->next;  

    /* 5. move the next of prev_node as new_node */
    prev_node->next = new_node;
}
```

### Deletion

![LinkedList Deletion](assets/heap/linkedlistdeletion.png)
```cpp
void deleteNode(struct Node **head_ref, int key)
{
    // Store head node
    struct Node* temp = *head_ref, *prev;

    // If head node itself holds the key to be deleted
    if (temp != NULL && temp->data == key)
    {
        *head_ref = temp->next;   // Changed head
        free(temp);               // free old head
        return;
    }

    // Search for the key to be deleted, keep track of the
    // previous node as we need to change 'prev->next'
    while (temp != NULL && temp->data != key)
    {
        prev = temp;
        temp = temp->next;
    }

    // If key was not present in linked list
    if (temp == NULL) return;

    // Unlink the node from linked list
    prev->next = temp->next;

    free(temp);  // Free memory
}
```

## Doubly linked list

```cpp
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next; // Pointer to next node in DLL
    struct Node* prev; // Pointer to previous node in DLL
};
```

**Advantages over singly linked list**
- A DLL can be traversed in both forward and backward direction.
- The delete operation in DLL is more efficient if pointer to the node to be deleted is given.
- We can quickly insert a new node before a given node.
In singly linked list, to delete a node, pointer to the previous node is needed. To get this previous node, sometimes the list is traversed. In DLL, we can get the previous node using previous pointer.


Disadvantages over singly linked list
- Every node of DLL Require extra space for an previous pointer. It is possible to implement DLL with single pointer though.
- All operations require an extra pointer previous to be maintained. For example, in insertion, we need to modify previous pointers together with next pointers. For example in following functions for insertions at different positions, we need 1 or 2 extra steps to set previous pointer.

## Circular Linked List

All nodes are connected to form a circle, no NULL at the end. A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or doubly circular linked list.

![CircularLinkedList](assets/heap/circularlinkedlist.png)

### Advantages

- Any node can be a starting point. We can traverse the whole list by starting from any point. We just need to stop when the first visited node is visited again.
- Useful for implementation of queue. Unlike this implementation, we donâ€™t need to maintain two pointers for front and rear if we use circular linked list. We can maintain a pointer to the last inserted node and front can always be obtained as next of last.
- Circular lists are useful in applications to repeatedly go around the list. For example, when multiple applications are running on a PC, it is common for the operating system to put the running applications on a list and then to cycle through them, giving each of them a slice of time to execute, and then making them wait while the CPU is given to another application. It is convenient for the operating system to use a circular list so that when it reaches the end of the list it can cycle around to the front of the list.
- Circular Doubly Linked Lists are used for implementation of advanced data structures like Fibonacci Heap.


## Trivias


### Middle of the LinkedList

Traverse linked list using two pointers. Move one pointer by one and other pointer by two. When the fast pointer reaches end slow pointer will reach middle of the linked list.

```
void getMiddle(struct Node *head)
{
    struct Node *slow_ptr = head;
    struct Node *fast_ptr = head;

    if (head!=NULL)
    {
        while (fast_ptr != NULL && fast_ptr->next != NULL)
        {
            fast_ptr = fast_ptr->next->next;
            slow_ptr = slow_ptr->next;
        }
        return slow_ptr->data;
    }
}
```
